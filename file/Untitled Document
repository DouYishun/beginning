First, make an ifstream:

#include <fstream>
std::ifstream infile("thefile.txt");

The two standard methods are:

    Assume that every line consists of two numbers and read token by token:

    int a, b;
    while (infile >> a >> b)
    {
        // process pair (a,b)
    }

    Line-based parsing, using string streams:

    #include <sstream>
    #include <string>

    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(infile, line))
    {
        std::istringstream iss(line);
        int a, b;
        if (!(iss >> a >> b)) { break; } // error

        // process pair (a,b)
    }

You shouldn't mix (1) and (2), since the token-based parsing doesn't gobble up newlines, so you may end up with spurious empty lines if you use getline() after token-based extraction got you to the end of a line already.
